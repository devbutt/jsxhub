description: Welcome to the JSxHub documentation.

What we have done here, is try to document everything we had to do inorder to compile the JSxHub web site.
The main webiste has been built using NextJS framework.

This documentation is being built using [ContentLayer](/docs/documentation/contentlayer) and MDX.

The inspiration to build out the documentation came from the Taxonomy web site built by [@shadcn](https://twitter.com/shadcn).
